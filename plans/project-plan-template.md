# Project Plan Template

## Goal

To provide a single, comprehensive document that captures the vision, goals,
user experience, and technical plan for the project. This document should be
clear enough for a new team member to understand the project's purpose and
direction.

---

## Part 1: The Vision (The "What" and "Why")

### 1.1. Problem & Vision Statement

*Answer the following questions:*
*   **What is the problem we are solving?** (Describe the user's pain point)
*   **Who are we solving it for?** (Describe the target audience)
*   **What is our proposed solution?** (The vision for the project)
*   **What is the high-level goal?** (e.g., "Create a web-based adventure game
    engine")

### 1.2. User Personas & Journeys

*This section should describe the target users and how they will interact with
the application.*

*   **User Personas:** (Optional)
    * *Create 1-3 fictional user personas. For each, include their goals,
      motivations, and frustrations.*
*   **User Journey(s):**
    * *Write a narrative for each key user journey. For example, "The Player's
      First Game," or "The Creator's First Room."*

### 1.3. High-Level Visual Concepts

*A lightweight, text-based section to provide a general sense of the visual
direction. This is not a detailed design spec.*

*   **Color Palette:** (e.g., Primary: #FFFFFF, Secondary: #000000)
*   **Typography:** (e.g., Headings: "Roboto", Body: "Open Sans")
*   **Inspirational Websites/Apps:** (Optional: List of websites or apps that
    have a similar look and feel)
*   **Key Screen Layouts:** (Optional: A text-based description of the layout
    for key screens. For example: "Main Game Screen: The top 80% of the screen
    is the room description. The bottom 20% is the command input field.")

### 1.5. Out of Scope

*What are we explicitly **not** building? This is crucial for managing
expectations.*

*   *(for example: "This project will not include real-time multiplayer.")*
*   *(for example: "We will not support mobile devices in the first version.")*

---

## Part 2: The Execution (The "How")

### 2.1. System Architecture

*A high-level overview of the technical components and how they interact.*

*   *(e.g., "A React single-page application that communicates with a RESTful
    API...")*

### 2.2. Key Technology Choices

*A list of the key technology choices and a brief justification for each. Think of frameworks, libraries, languages*

### 2.3. Modules 

*A breakdown of the major functional areas and components of the application.
This helps to divide the work and understand the system's structure.*

### 2.4. Testing Strategy

*A description of the testing strategy for the project. Think of unit,
component, and integration tests*
